# alice2bob

## Synopsis

Alice who lives on the planet Efrion has been selected for the alpha of a new program. The interplanetary networking device integrates human brains with the hardware, but because it is still in alpha the user must navigate using a command-line-like interface with their eyes closed.  Excited about this new software, Alice immediately starts the program to send a message to Bob on Earth. Because of the distance, Alice is not able to instantly access Earth’s servers so she must relay through network nodes on various planets in between. On her way to Bob’s CPU, Alice finds out that some of the alpha users have some malicious intents and will prevent them from causing destruction.
